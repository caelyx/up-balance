# up-balance 
**Check the balance of your Up account from the terminal**

Up has a read-only API available to their customers, documented [here](https://developer.up.com.au/). 
This tiny utility prints the balance of each account you have, and a grand total.

**Steps:**
* Get yourself an API key at [api.up.com.au](https://api.up.com.au/);
* Put the API key in config.py;
* `./up.py`

**Result:**
```
